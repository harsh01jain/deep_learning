# Description
"I have completed a project on predicting sleep disorders using the decision tree
algorithm in machine learning. The project involved analyzing a dataset with
various features like age, gender, BMI, and sleep-related data. By implementing
the decision tree algorithm, I developed a predictive model that can identify 
individuals at risk of sleep disorders based on their demographic and sleep-related
characteristics. This project's outcome is a valuable tool for early detection and 
intervention in sleep disorders, potentially leading to improved quality of life for
many individuals."
