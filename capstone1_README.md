I predicted heart disease using machine learning! I used a dataset with information about people's age, sex, blood pressure,cholesterol 
levels, and other health metrics. By analyzing this data, my model can predict the likelihood of someone developing heart disease. 
This helps identify high-risk individuals early so they can take preventive measures, like changing their lifestyle or taking 
medication, to reduce their risk. It's all about using data to protect people's heart health!

I have done both undersapmling and oversampling in it and **8 different models** were used to compare which was the best model for
which scenario so for **undersampling** **catboosting algorithm** came out to be the best with an accuracy of **0.75%** and for the **oversampling**
**random forest** came out to be best with an accuracy of **0.95%**
